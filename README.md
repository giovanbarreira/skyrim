# skyrim
Codes and scripts for those who are curious.

Those xc files inside the scripts folder must be in the same folder as the SkyrimSE.exe in the installation folder.
Example:
C:/Install/Path/SkyrimAnniversaryEdition
			|
			|
			SkyrimSE.exe
			SkyrimSELauncher.exe
			xc_setessential_riverwood.txt

Those scripts run great with GOG edition.

To run those scripts (lest's say xc_setessential_riverwood.txt), access the console mode inside the game and execute:
bat xc_setessential_riverwood (without the .txt extension)

Those scripts are native and were made in notepad.
